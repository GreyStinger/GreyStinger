<h2 align="center">Hey there, I'm Jayden</h2>

I'm a South African programmer who's been developing software for a few years
now.

##### More About Me

- I love low level languages and the challenges they bring.
- Embedded systems are great and optimization workloads are amazingly enjoyable.
- I enjoy working on, using and contributing to the open source ecosystem.
- I use <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GreyStinger/GreyStinger/refs/heads/master/assets/nixos-colorful.svg" alt="nix logo" style="height: 1em; width: 1em; vertical-align: bottom;" /> OS and really ❤️ it
- Outside of my computer, I enjoy cycling, working out and running fitness wise,
    and I spend the rest of my time working on conservation projects or at the
    race track.

##### Current Goals

- Release the lightweight c/lua webserver/proxy I've been working on.
- Improve the C and C++ representation on my profile.

### Low Profile activity

My profile has seen less activity as I've been finishing my AS levels for school
but now that that's done and I'm back things should pick up a bit.
