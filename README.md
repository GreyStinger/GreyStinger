<h1 align="center">Welcome To The Home Of Grey!</h1>

My names Jayden, I'm a hobbyist developer who has a few projects under construction, I'll finish some soon I'm sure but we all think that don't we..

### I'm Not Very Active

I'm not active at the moment, and thats mostly due to school not leaving me much free time.

I am trying to step up my game slightly though.

### Some Stats:

It pains me to see so much JS, sorry ES dev's, not meant to offend, just not a personal preference. 

Everything is built with it though so what choice do I have T-T
